To run the program, you must compile all .h and .cpp in the directory. To do this type g++ *.h *.cpp, and then type ./a.out to run the executable.

Once running, the program will first prompt for the name of a configuration file. Type for example "config1.txt" or "config2.txt".

If you misstype the name of the configuration file, the program will now run properly.

If all files necesaary to run the program, along with the config files, population files, and region arent in the same directory, the program will not run.

No makefile available, you must type g++ *.h *.cpp, and then type ./a.out to run the executable.
